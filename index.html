        <h2>Why Maui?</h2>
        <h3> Maui, known also as “The Valley Isle,” is the second largest Hawaiian island.</h3>
      <p>The island of Maui (/ˈmaʊi/; Hawaiian: [ˈmɐwwi])[3] is the second-largest of the islands of the state of Hawaii at 727.2 square miles (1,883 km2), and the 17th-largest island in the United States.[4] Maui is the largest of Maui County's four islands, which include Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and unpopulated Kahoʻolawe.</p>
    <p>Maui's diverse landscapes are the result of a unique combination of geology, topography, and climate. Each volcanic cone in the chain of the Hawaiian Islands is built of dark, iron-rich/quartz-poor rocks, which poured out of thousands of vents as highly fluid lava throughout millions of years. Several of the volcanoes were close enough to each other that lava flows on their flanks overlapped one another, merging into a single island. Maui is such a "volcanic doublet," formed from two shield volcanoes that overlapped one another to form an isthmus between them.[8]
